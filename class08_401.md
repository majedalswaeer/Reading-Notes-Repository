# List Comprehensions in Python
- To understand the list comprehension, imagine it like this: youâ€™re going to perform an expression on each item in the list. The expression will determine what item is eventually stored in the output list. 

 - List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
 - In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
 - More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods


`Create a List with range() `

```
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)
```

```
squares=[]

for x in range(0,11):
    x=x**2 
    squares.append(x)

    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

```

`Multiplying Parts of a List`
- What if we wanted to multiply every number in a list by three in Python? We could write a for loop and store the results in a new list, or we could use list comprehensions.

```
list=[x*3 for x in range(0,10)]
```

`Print numbers only from a given string`
- Another interesting exercise is to extract numbers from a string. For example, we may have a database of names and phone numbers.

```
# user data entered as name and phone number
user_data = "Elvis Presley 987-654-3210"

my_num=[x for x in user_data if x%2==0]
print(my_num)
['9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1', '0']
```
