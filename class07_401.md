# Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code
- In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

- 1- `Global scope`: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

- 2- `Local scope`: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

- In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.

## Functions: The Local Scope

The `local scope` or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever you call the function at hand.

By default, parameters and names that you assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten. Here’s how this works:

```
>>> def square(base):
...     result = base ** 2
...     print(f'The square of {base} is: {result}')
...
>>> square(10)
The square of 10 is: 100
>>> result  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    result
NameError: name 'result' is not defined
>>> base  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    base
NameError: name 'base' is not defined
>>> square(20)
The square of 20 is: 400

```

## The nonlocal Statement
 - Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. If you want to modify them, then you need to use a nonlocal statement. With a nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.

 - The nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope. The following example shows how you can use nonlocal to modify a variable defined in the enclosing or nonlocal scope:
 ```
 >> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```

## globals()
 - In Python, globals() is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary. This dictionary always stores the names of the current module. This means that if you call globals() in a given module, then you’ll get a dictionary containing all the names that you’ve defined in that module, right before the call to globals(). Here’s an example:
 ```
 >>> globals()
{'__name__': '__main__',..., '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>}
>>> my_var = 100
>>> globals()
{'__name__': '__main__',..., 'my_var': 100}
```
he `first call` to globals() returns a dictionary containing the names in your `__main__` module or program. Note that when you assign a new name at the top level of the module, like in my_var = 100, the name is added to the dictionary returned by `globals()`.
