# nosql vs sql

## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL database

| SQL                                                              |   No-SQL                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------  | -------------------     |
|SQL databases  called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)             |called as non-relational or distributed database.|
|table based databases                                             |document based databases |
|SQL databases have predefined schema                              |NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.| 
|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data                                                               |In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.|
|SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage       | NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* Ans: SQL is a  good fit for the complex query intensive environment 

## Give a real world example.
* Ans:  MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
* Ans:  fits better for the hierarchical data storage

## Give a real world example.
* Ans: Hbase

* Ans: NoSQL data base

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
* Ans: SQL databases

## What does SQL stand for?
* Ans: Structured query language
## What is a realational database?
* Ans: It is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* Ans: Logical data structures
## What is a ‘schema’?
* Ans: It is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information
## What is a NoSQL database?
* Ans: itis an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases
## Howo does it work?
* Ans: it making a shift away from traditional relational database management systems 
## What is inside of a Mongo database?
* Ans:It stores data records as documents
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
* Ans: MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
* Ans: They don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases
