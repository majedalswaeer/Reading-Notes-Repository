# OAuth

## What is OAuth?
* Ans: OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.
## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
* Ans: when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.
## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
* OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption.
1-The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

2-The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

3- The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

4- The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

5- If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

6- The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

7- The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

8- The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

9- The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

10- The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

11- The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption.

## What is OpenID?
* Ans: OpenID is a security technologies about authentication, its for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans.

# Authorization and Authentication flows

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
* Ans: Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.
## What is Authorization Code Flow?
* Ans: Authorization code flow is used to obtain an access token to authorize API requests.
## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
* Ans: an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users
## What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
* Ans: Implicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates.
## What is Client Credentials Flow?
* Ans: The Client Credentials flow is a server to server flow. There is no user authentication involved in the process
## What is Device Authorization Flow?
* Ans: Device Authorization Flow happens With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. 
## What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
* Ans: its requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form. The Resource Owner Password Flow should only be used when redirect-based flows
