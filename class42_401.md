# Python Iterators That Iterate Forever
- We’ll begin by writing a class that demonstrates the bare-bones iterator protocol in Python. The example I’m using here might look different from the examples you’ve seen in other iterator tutorials, but bear with me. I think doing it this way gives you a more applicable understanding of how iterators work in Python.

- Over the next few paragraphs we’re going to implement a class called Repeater that can be iterated over with a for-in loop, like so:
```
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```

- Like its name suggests, instances of this Repeater class will repeatedly return a single value when iterated over. So the above example code would print the string Hello to the console forever.

- To start with the implementation we’ll define and flesh out the Repeater class first:
```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return RepeaterIterator(self)
```
- On first inspection, Repeater looks like a bog-standard Python class. But notice how it also includes the __iter__ dunder method.

- What’s the RepeaterIterator object we’re creating and returning from __iter__? It’s a helper class we also need to define for our for-in iteration example to work:
```
class RepeaterIterator:
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source

    def __next__(self):
        return self.source.value
```
- Again, RepeaterIterator looks like a straightforward Python class, but you might want to take note of the following two things:

- In the __init__ method we link each RepeaterIterator instance to the Repeater object that created it. That way we can hold on to the “source” object that’s being iterated over.

- In RepeaterIterator.__next__, we reach back into the “source” Repeater instance and return the value associated with it.

- In this code example, Repeater and RepeaterIterator are working together to support Python’s iterator protocol. The two dunder methods we defined, __iter__ and __next__, are the key to making a Python object iterable.

- We’ll take a closer look at these two methods and how they work together after some hands-on experimentation with the code we’ve got so far.

- Let’s confirm that this two-class setup really made Repeater objects compatible with for-in loop iteration. To do that we’ll first create an instance of Repeater that would return the string 'Hello' indefinitely:
```
>>> repeater = Repeater('Hello')
And now we’re going to try iterating over this repeater object with a for-in loop. What’s going to happen when you run the following code snippet?

>>> for item in repeater:
...     print(item)
Right on! You’ll see 'Hello' printed to the screen…a lot. Repeater keeps on returning the same string value, and so, this loop will never complete. Our little program is doomed to print 'Hello' to the console forever:

Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
...
```
- But congratulations—you just wrote a working iterator in Python and used it with a for-in loop. The loop may not terminate yet…but so far, so good!

- Next up we’ll tease this example apart to understand how the __iter__ and __next__ methods work together to make a Python object iterable.

- Pro tip: If you ran the last example inside a Python REPL session or from the terminal and you want to stop it, hit Ctrl + C a few times to break out of the infinite loop.

## How do for-in loops work in Python?
- At this point we’ve got our Repeater class that apparently supports the iterator protocol, and we just ran a for-in loop to prove it:
```
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```
- Now, what does this for-in loop really do behind the scenes? How does it communicate with the repeater object to fetch new elements from it?

- To dispel some of that “magic” we can expand this loop into a slightly longer code snippet that gives the same result:
```
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```
- As you can see, the for-in was just syntactic sugar for a simple while loop:

- It first prepared the repeater object for iteration by calling its __iter__ method. This returned the actual iterator object.
After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator object’s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.
If you’ve ever worked with database cursors, this mental model will seem familiar: We first initialize the cursor and prepare it for reading, and then we can fetch data into local variables as needed from it, one element at a time.

- Because there’s never more than one element “in flight”, this approach is highly memory-efficient. Our Repeater class provides an infinite sequence of elements and we can iterate over it just fine. Emulating the same with a Python list would be impossible—there’s no way we could create a list with an infinite number of elements in the first place. This makes iterators a very powerful concept.

- On more abstract terms, iterators provide a common interface that allows you to process every element of a container while being completely isolated from the container’s internal structure.

- Whether you’re dealing with a list of elements, a dictionary, an infinite sequence like the one provided by our Repeater class, or another sequence type—all of that is just an implementation detail. Every single one of these objects can be traversed in the same way by the power of iterators.

- And as you’ve seen, there’s nothing special about for-in loops in Python. If you peek behind the curtain, it all comes down to calling the right dunder methods at the right time.

- In fact, you can manually “emulate” how the loop used the iterator protocol in a Python interpreter session:
```
>>> repeater = Repeater('Hello')
>>> iterator = iter(repeater)
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hello'
...
```
- This gives the same result: An infinite stream of hellos. Every time you call next() the iterator hands out the same greeting again.

- By the way, I took the opportunity here to replace the calls to __iter__ and __next__ with calls to Python’s built-in functions iter() and next().

- Internally these built-ins invoke the same dunder methods, but they make this code a little prettier and easier to read by providing a clean “facade” to the iterator protocol.

- Python offers these facades for other functionality as well. For example, len(x) is a shortcut for calling x.__len__. Similarly, calling iter(x) invokes x.__iter__ and calling next(x) invokes x.__next__.

- Generally it’s a good idea to use the built-in facade functions rather than directly accessing the dunder methods implementing a protocol. It just makes the code a little easier to read.

## A Simpler Iterator Class
- Up until now our iterator example consisted of two separate classes, Repeater and RepeaterIterator. They corresponded directly to the two phases used by Python’s iterator protocol:

- First setting up and retrieving the iterator object with an iter() call, and then repeatedly fetching values from it via next().

- Many times both of these responsibilities can be shouldered by a single class. Doing this allows you to reduce the amount of code necessary to write a class-based iterator.

## Python Generators 101 – The Basics
- Let’s start by looking again at the Repeater example that I previously used to introduce the idea of iterators. It implemented a class-based iterator cycling through an infinite sequence of values.

- This is what the class looked like in its second (simplified) version:
```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```
- If you’re thinking, “that’s quite a lot of code for such a simple iterator,” you’re absolutely right. Parts of this class seem rather formulaic, as if they would be written in exactly the same way from one class-based iterator to the next.

- This is where Python’s generators enter the scene. If I rewrite this iterator class as a generator, it looks like this:
```
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```
- We just went from seven lines of code to three.

- Not bad, eh? As you can see, generators look like regular functions but instead of using the return statement, they use yield to pass data back to the caller.

- Will this new generator implementation still work the same way as our class-based iterator did? Let’s bust out the for-in loop test to find out:


- Yep! We’re still looping through our greetings forever. This much shorter generator implementation seems to perform the same way that the Repeater class did.

- (Remember to hit Ctrl+C if you want out of the infinite loop in an interpreter session.)

- Now, how do these generators work? They look like normal functions, but their behavior is quite different. For starters, calling a generator function doesn’t even run the function. It merely creates and returns a generator object:

- If you read the code of the repeater function again, it looks like the yield keyword in there somehow stops this generator function in mid-execution and then resumes it at a later point in time:
```
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```
- And that’s quite a fitting mental model for what happens here. You see, when a return statement is invoked inside a function, it permanently passes control back to the caller of the function. When a yield is invoked, it also passes control back to the caller of the function—but it only does so temporarily.

- Whereas a return statement disposes of a function’s local state, a yield statement suspends the function and retains its local state.

- In practical terms, this means local variables and the execution state of the generator function are only stashed away temporarily and not thrown out completely.

- Execution can be resumed at any time by calling next() on the generator:
```
>>> iterator = repeater('Hi')
>>> next(iterator)
'Hi'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hi'
>>> next(iterator)
'Hi'
```
- This makes generators fully compatible with the iterator protocol. For this reason, I like to think of them primarily as syntactic sugar for implementing iterators.

- You’ll find that for most types of iterators, writing a generator function will be easier and more readable than defining a long-winded class-based iterator.
