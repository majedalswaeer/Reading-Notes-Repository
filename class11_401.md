# JupyterLab 
- `JupyterLab` is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning.
- `JupyterLab` enables you to arrange your work area with notebooks, text files, terminals, and notebook outputs. JupyterLab provides a high level of integration between notebooks, documents, and activities: Drag-and-drop to reorder notebook cells and copy them between notebooks.
# NumPy
- `NumPy`, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment. It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. An introduction to Matplotlib is also provided. All this is explained with the help of examples for better understanding.

# Operations using NumPy
Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations :

    - Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

    - Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

    - Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

- Standard Python distribution doesn't come bundled with NumPy module. A lightweight alternative is to install NumPy using popular Python package installer, pip.
```
pip install numpy
```
## Data Type Objects (dtype)
- A data type object describes interpretation of fixed block of memory corresponding to an array, depending on the following aspects âˆ’

- Type of data (integer, float or Python object)

    - Size of data

    - Byte order (little-endian or big-endian)
