# Assets, Metadata, and CSS in NEXT.JS
- D0wnload Starter Code (Optional)
- If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a nextjs-blog directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

- Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.
    ```
    npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/assets-metadata-css-starter"
    ```
- Then follow the instructions from the command output (cd into the directory and start the development server).

## Assets
- Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application similar to pages.

- The public directory is also useful for robots.txt, Google Site Verification, and any other static assets. Check out the documentation for Static File Serving to learn more.

- Download Your Profile Picture
- First, let's retrieve your profile picture.

- Download your profile picture in .jpg format (or use this file).
- Create an images directory inside of the public directory.
- Save the picture as profile.jpg in the public/images directory.
- The image size can be around 400px by 400px.
- You may remove the unused SVG logo file directly under the public directory.
- Unoptimized Image
With regular HTML, you would add your profile picture as follows:
```
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Your Name" />
```
- However, this means you have to manually handle:

- Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes
Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library
Only loading images when they enter the viewport
And more. Instead, Next.js provides an Image component out of the box to handle this for you.

- Image Component and Image Optimization
next/image is an extension of the HTML <img> element, evolved for the modern web.

- Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it. This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.

- Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.

## Using the Image Component
- Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, your build times aren't increased, whether shipping 10 images or 10 million images.

- Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.

- Images are always rendered in such a way as to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift, a Core Web Vital that Google is going to use in search ranking.

- Here's an example using next/image to display our profile picture. The height and width props should be the desired rendering size, with an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

- Note: We'll use this component later in "Polishing Layout", no need to copy it yet.
```
import Image from 'next/image'

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
)
```

## What problems does React context solve?
- React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

- Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

- Here is an example of props drilling. In this application, we have access to theme data that we want to pass as a prop to all of our app's components.

- As you can see, however, the direct children of App, such as Header, also have to pass the theme data down using props.

## How do I use React context?
- Context is an API that is built into React, starting from React version 16.

- This means that we can create and use context directly by importing React in any React project.

- There are four steps to using React context:

- Create context using the createContext method.
- Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
- Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
- Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.
- Does all this sound confusing? It's simpler than you think.
