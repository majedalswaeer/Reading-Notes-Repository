# Data Science Primer
- `Machine learning` is about teaching the computer to orgnize patterns in our data by specific algorthim, our data will have, there is key words we have to learn about like model,algorithim, test data, training data and so on
- `Exploratory Analysis`: Proper exploratory analysis is about answering questions. It's about extracting enough insights from your dataset to course correct before you get lost in the weeds.

- `Data Cleaning`: proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step. Why? Because of a simple truth in machine learning:Better data beats fancier algorithms.

- `Feature Engineering`: Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

- In general, you can think of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.

- This is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for 3 big reasons:

    - 1- You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.
    - 2- You can bring in your own domain expertise.
    - 3- Most importantly, once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise!

- `Algorithm Selection`: is to How Pick ML Algorithms
- `Model Training`: its about spliting our data into training and test sets, Training sets are used to fit and tune your models. Test sets are put aside as "unseen" data to evaluate your models.
