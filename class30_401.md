## What is django?
- Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an independent organization established in the US as a 501 non-profit.

## Why Django?
- Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to "do the right things" to protect the website automatically

## How we use django?
- You can create the new directory named 'project-blog' by using 'mkdir' command in your Desktop.
Change the directory to 'project-blog' by using 'cd' command.
- add django and other required libraries

- For Activating your Virtual Environment: The Virtual Environment can be activated by using the 'poetry shell' command .

- create a project and app for django

- edit sittings, urls, and add your app to the installed apps

## Hashtables
- What is a Hashtable?
- Terminology:

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
- Why do we use them?
- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library
- What Are they
- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

- The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

- Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. This is ideal when quick lookups are required.

- Example
```
["Greenwood:98103", "Downtown:98101", "Alki Beach:98116", "Bainbridge Island:9
```

## Structure
### Hashing
- Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

### Creating a Hash
- A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. I always like the size 1024. this is important for index placement. After you have created your array of the appropriate size, do some sort of logic to turn that “key” into a numeric number value. Here is a possible suggestion:

    - Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
    - Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
    - Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
    - Insert into the array at that index.

### Hash function
- A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

- To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

- Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.

- Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

- Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

- Note: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is important to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.
