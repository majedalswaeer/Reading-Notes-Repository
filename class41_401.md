# Next.js - Dynamic Routes
- How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes ?
    - We want each post to have the path /posts/<id>, where <id> is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
    - Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, we’d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.
- Implement getStaticPaths
    - Create a file called [id].js inside the pages/posts directory.
    - Also, remove first-post.js inside the pages/posts directory — we’ll no longer use this.
    - Then, open pages/posts/[id].js in your editor and paste the following code. We’ll fill in ... later:
    ```
        import Layout from '../../components/layout'

        export default function Post() {
        return <Layout>...</Layout>
    }
    ```
    ```
    export function getAllPostIds() {
    const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

    // Returns an array that looks like this:
    // [
    //   {
    //     params: {
    //       id: 'ssg-ssr'
    //     }
    //   },
    //   {
    //     params: {
    //       id: 'pre-rendering'
    //     }
    //   }
    // ]
    return fileNames.map(fileName => {
        return {
        params: {
            id: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '')
        }
        }
    })
    }
    ```
    ```
    import { getAllPostIds } from '../../lib/posts'

    export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const paths = getAllPostIds()
    return {
        paths,
        fallback: false
    }
    }
    ```
## Deployment
- The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

- Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.

- Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

- Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
Vercel has many more features, such as:

- Custom Domains: Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.
Environment Variables: You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.
Automatic HTTPS: HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.

- Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

- If you’ve followed the instructions so far, your package.json should have the following build and start scripts:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```
