# What is docker ?
- Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels

# Why docker ?
- It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

# How its used ?
- By downloading docker and run the commands existed in docker documentation

## Graphs
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

- Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

    - Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
    Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
    Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
    Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- Directed vs Undirected
    - Undirected Graphs
    An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

    - For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional.

- Undirected Graph

    - The undirected graph we are looking at has 6 vertices and 7 undirected edges.

    - Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

    - Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

- Directed Graphs (Digraph)
    - A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

    - Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

    - Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.

- DirectedGraph

    - The directed graph above has six vertices and eight directed edges

    - Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

    - Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}

    - Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
    There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

    - The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

- Complete Graphs
    - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- CompleteGraph

    - Take a close look at each of the vertices in the graph above. Do you notice that each vertex is actually connected to every other node on the graph? That is what makes it a complete graph.

    Connected
    A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
