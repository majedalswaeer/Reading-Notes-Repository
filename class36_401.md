# White Board interview tips
- Communicate between you and the interviewer
- Ask about edge cases
- Start with a pseudo code 
- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
- Take you time while understanding the problem
- Speak while thinking of the problem
- Ask about the input
- Visiulize the problem 
- Think out loud more. 
    - Say what you know. Say what you thought might work and why it won't work. You might realize it actually does work, or a modified version does. Or you might get a hint.

- Wait for a hint. 
    - Don't stare at your interviewer expectantly, but do take a brief second to "think"â€”your interviewer might have already decided to give you a hint and is just waiting to avoid interrupting.

- Think about the bounds on space and runtime. 
    - If you're not sure if you can optimize your solution, think about it out loud. For example:

- Apply a common algorithmic pattern. 
    - There are a few patterns that come up again and again in the answers to these questions. Once you know the patterns, designing an algorithm is just a matter of trying a few of them and seeing which one sticks.
