# How to use the Random Module in Python
### Types of Random Functions 
- `Randint`: If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second. example below:
```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
```
- `Choice`

```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```
- `Shuffle`: The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary
```
- `Randrange`: Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

```
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```
### What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

- Why use `Risk Analysis`?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

- Possible risks that you could encounter

- [x]Use of new hardware
- [x]Use of new technology
- [x]Use of new automation tool
- [x]The sequence of code
- [x]Availability of test resources for the application

### TestCoverage
- Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests. If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy, but not thinking about what they are doing.

- The reason, of course, why people focus on coverage numbers is because they want to know if they are testing enough. Certainly low coverage numbers, say below half, are a sign of trouble. But high numbers don't necessarily mean much, and lead to ignorance-promoting dashboards. Sufficiency of testing is much more complicated attribute than coverage can answer. I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:

- You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

### Bid O notation
- Big O is essentially an equation that describes how the runtime scales with respect to some input variables.

- Also, Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

- To calculate Big O, you can go through each line of code and establish whether it's O(1), O(n) etc and then return your calculation at the end.
