# Permissions
- ## **How permissions are determined ?**

- Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

- Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails an exceptions.PermissionDenied or exceptions.NotAuthenticated exception will be raised, and the main body of the view will not run.

- When the permissions checks fail either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

- The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate WWW-Authenticate header will be returned.

## Object level permissions
- REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

- Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called. As with view level permissions, an exceptions.PermissionDenied exception will be raised if the user is not allowed to act on the given object.

- If you're writing your own views and want to enforce object level permissions, or if you override the get_object method on a generic view, then you'll need to explicitly call the .check_object_permissions(request, obj) method on the view at the point at which you've retrieved the object.

- This will either raise a PermissionDenied or NotAuthenticated exception, or simply return if the view has the appropriate permissions.

```
For example:

def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

## DjangoObjectPermissions
- This permission class ties into Django's standard object permissions framework that allows per-object permissions on models. In order to use this permission class, you'll also need to add a permission backend that supports object-level permissions, such as django-guardian.

- As with DjangoModelPermissions, this permission must only be applied to views that have a .queryset property or .get_queryset() method. Authorization will only be granted if the user is authenticated and has the relevant per-object permissions and relevant model permissions assigned.

- POST requests require the user to have the add permission on the model instance.PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the model instance.
DELETE requests require the user to have the delete permission on the model instance. Note that DjangoObjectPermissions does not require the django-guardian package, and should support other object-level backends equally well.

- As with DjangoModelPermissions you can use custom model permissions by overriding DjangoObjectPermissions and setting the .perms_map property. Refer to the source code for details.

- Note: If you need object level view permissions for GET, HEAD and OPTIONS requests and are using django-guardian for your object-level permissions backend, you'll want to consider using the DjangoObjectPermissionsFilter class provided by the djangorestframework-guardian package. It ensures that list endpoints only return results including objects for which the user has appropriate view permissions.

## Custom permissions
- To implement a custom permission, override BasePermission and implement either, or both, of the following methods:

- .has_permission(self, request, view)
- .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)

The methods should return True if the request should be granted access, and False otherwise.

If you need to test if a request is a read operation or a write operation, you should check the request method against the constant SAFE_METHODS, which is a tuple containing 'GET', 'OPTIONS' and 'HEAD'. For example:
```
if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
    # Check permissions for read-only request
else:
    # Check permissions for write request
```
