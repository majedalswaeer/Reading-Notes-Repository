# Links Defenation
## Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
### Writing Links: Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute, ex below:

```
<p>Movie Reviews:
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
 Empire</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.metacritic.com">
 Metacritic</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com">
 Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.variety.com">
 Variety</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
```
### Opening Links in a New Window: If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank
### Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page: If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique.
## Layout
### to create creative layout we will use the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. such as : Normal flow, Relative Positioning, Absolute positioning
### Screen Sizes: Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
### Screen Resolution: Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
## FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS 
### Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code, Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements), Also, Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
