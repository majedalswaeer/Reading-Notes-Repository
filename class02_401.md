## there are sevral types of tests to test our work and to make sure that we are in the right path,
## Types :
1-Unit Tests – It is a piece of a code that invokes another piece of code (unit) and checks if an output of that action is the same as the desired output.
Integration Tests – It is testing a unit without full control over all parties in the test. They are using one or more of its outside dependencies, such as a database, threads, network, time, etc.
2- Functional Tests – It is testing a slice of a functionality of the system, observing it as a black box and verifying the output of the system to the functional specification.
3- Acceptance Tests – It is testing does the system fulfill expected business and contract requirements. It is considering the system as a black box

## What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
### actually it was explanied in the lab today, If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable, such as :

```
# Python program to use
# main for function call.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_function()
 
import myscript
 
myscript.my_function()

```

## Recursion
### he process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function, we used it in fibonacci problem, this idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0. 
### What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?
