## HTML Tags Defenition
### - When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page
## Tag's Types :
1- Heading
2- Paragraph
3- bold and etalic
4- Superscript & Subscript
## Semantic Markup Defenition
### text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages
***
## CSS
### - CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface
### Different versions of CSS & Browser Quirks : CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to implement it, CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement, Statements should end with a semicolon, such as :
```
var today= new Date{); 
var hourNow = today.getHours{) ; 
var greeting; 
if (hourNow > 18) { 
greeting= 'Good evening'; 
else if (hourNow > 12) { 
greeting= 'Good afternoon'; 
else if (hourNow > O) { 
greeting 'Good morning'; 
else { 
greeting 'Welcome'; 
document.write(greeting) ;
```
### WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
#### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
## DATA TYPES
1- NUMERIC DATA TYPE
2- STRING DATA TYPE
3- BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
## OPERATORS TYPES
1- ARITHMETI C OPERATORS
2- STRING OPERATOR
## Decisions and Loops
### - Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations, Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:
* EVALUATIONS: You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results 
* DECISIONS: Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. 
* LOOPS: There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.
